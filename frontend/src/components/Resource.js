                        <h1>Two minutes to understand sustainable development</h1>
                        <p>By incorporating sustainable development into innovation, companies can create products, services, and processes that benefit both society and the organization. Sustainable development is crucial for a company's long-term survival and growth. Organizations that neglect sustainability may fall behind their competitors and risk going out of business. However, traditional approaches to development may yield profitable outcomes but can also harm employees or over-exploit natural resources.
                        These unsustainable practices can lead to long-term negative impacts, both environmentally and socially.

                        <p>By building sustainability into innovation, companies can create products, services, and processes that are good for both society and the organization.  

Innovation is vital for a company's survival and growth. Firms that don't innovate fall behind their competitors and ultimately go out of business. 

However, traditional forms of innovation may result in profitable products, services, and processes : but also harm employees or over-exploit natural resources.
